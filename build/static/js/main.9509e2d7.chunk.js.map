Esse tempo foi marcado por vários bate-volta na praia e alguns nasceres do sol de mãos dadas, até que o amor desabrochou. Nosso namoro foi sempre baseado em “nossa como a gente consegue combinar em tudo?”.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSomos tão parecidos quanto o bordô é do marsala, nos completamos de uma forma que nos faz acreditar até que existe sim alma gêmea. E foi esse amor tão puro e simples que nos deu a certeza mais concreta dentro de nós: queremos passar o resto da vida juntos!\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNão somos perfeitos, mas somos livres para sermos imperfeitos um com o outro, e poder viver isso é único e maravilhoso.
